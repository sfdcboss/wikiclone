## Scope

The diagram should show from a project management perspective how tests should be called out for in each individual Pivotal Tracker Story.  This does not cover the full QA Testing process, only the portion of story grooming that is a repository for ideas of where features may impact.

## Details

There is more information related to tests as a whole here in Quality Assurance.  This particular process should be part of the sprint and the sprint meetings,  with the owner being the QA.   The tasks listed in the story though that would create test cases for the test plan is collaborative and PM should have input on if an area is important to test that could be related to another feature. 

- PM Entering story adds anything relevant as a "Task" in pivotal Tracker at the time of story creation
- Lead Tech adds testing areas as part of "Design Review"
- QA uses any ideas from PM and Lead Tech and ultimately creates a list of tasks that will update the Test Plan that exists in SF.com.
