# Standup Daily Meeting
{: .no_toc }

## Scope 
Defintions of what is intended to be done in the standup and some ideas of how to get those conversations started and flowing.

## Purpose
Standups are supposed to be short, hence the name standup (too short to sit) and are to clear blockers as quickly as possible.  The quicker we socialize a blocker and figure out a solution the better and it gives a chance also to catch up with the team.  

## References
